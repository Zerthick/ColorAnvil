# ColorAnvil

ColorAnvil is a simple plugin to enable the use of Minecraft formatting codes when naming items within anvils. Currently all of the formatting codes as described by the [Official Minecraft Wiki](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes) are supported. To use a formatting code simply prefix the desired code with an `&`. **Note:** This is diffferent from Vanilla Minecraft which utilizes an `ยง`.

For example, if I wanted to change the color of a Diamond Sword's name to dark-red I could rename it to _&4Diamond Sword_

# Permissions

* `coloranvil.use` - Allows the player to utilize formatting codes while naming items.  
* `coloranvil.color.<format_code>` - Allows the player to utilize a specific formatting code where `format_code` is the code without the `&`. 
  * **Ex:** `coloranvil.color.a`

## Support Me
I will **never** charge money for the use of my plugins, however they do require a significant amount of work to maintain and update. If you'd like to show your support and buy me a cup of tea sometime (I don't drink that horrid coffee stuff :P) you can do so [here](https://www.paypal.me/zerthick)
